# MSR-VTT download and trim the videos from YouTube 

MSR-VTT (Microsoft Research Video-to-Text) is a benchmark dataset for video–language understanding.

The dataset consists of 10,000 short videos from YouTube. Due to copy write reasons, it is difficult to find a complete dataset with the video files, including audio. 

It is very easy to find the [metadata](https://github.com/ev2900/MSR-VTT_Build/blob/main/video_metadata.json) for each video.

I built this set of scripts so you can download the videos from YouTube and trim them to the specifications of the MSR-VTT benchmark.
